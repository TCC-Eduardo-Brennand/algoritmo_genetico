# Optimization of Formula 1 Racing Strategies: An Approach Based on Exploratory Analysis and Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains the source code for the genetic algorithm developed for the scientific paper *Optimization of Formula 1 Racing Strategies: An Approach Based on Exploratory Analysis and Genetic Algorithms*.

## Description

The project aims to find the best pit stop strategy and tire compound selection for a Formula 1 race using genetic algorithms. The model seeks to minimize the total race time by considering different tire combinations and optimal pit stop moments.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12.3**
- **Pandas** for data analysis and manipulation
- **NumPy** for mathematical operations
- **FastF1** for obtaining historical Formula 1 race data

## Results

The algorithm was tested with real data from past Formula 1 seasons and demonstrated efficiency in optimizing pit stop strategies. Comparative analysis showed that the genetic algorithm approach can find competitive solutions compared to strategies used by real teams.

## Authors
